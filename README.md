Computing Invariant Set via Zonotopes and some optimization tools in Julia

In this project, I worked on approximating the finite horizon invariance kernel of an affine system using zonotope scaling as a set representation. My contributions include replacing the previous heuristic objective function with the exact zonotope volume function, testing and proving the convexity of zonotopes under scaling, and implementing optimization routines using Julia.
I documented the results as a presentations to my peers.
